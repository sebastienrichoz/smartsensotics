%% function node_force(nodes,edges,idx)
% Compute displacement "force" on node in a pseudo-physical 
% spring model:
% - If length of current node to neightbor is longer than rest: be attracted to neighbor
% - If length of current node to neighbor is shorter than rest: be repulsed by neighbor
%
% Parameters:
%   nodes:              All nodes of shape to optimise
%   edges:              All edges of shape to optimise
%   edge_target_len:    Length of edges at rest (target).
%
% Returns:
%   fvall:              Matrix of 3D force vectors
%                       Each line corresponds to the force for the
%                       corresponding node.
